review_text: "As someone who works in the arts, I’ve seen a lot of really good and polished websites, but my favourite is definitely the one Maciej made for me. My whole vision was fulfilled perfectly. I highly recommend. I needed an aesthetically pleasing website to promote my art and I got a better result than I imagined."

### Who is Jakub Kępka?
Jakub Kępka is a Warsaw based, artist and fashion designer.
### The Problem
Image heavy website that needed to be fast, aesthetically pleasing, and have an easy way for non technical user to add, update, and delete new content.
### Solution
I used JAMStack approach to develop the website, I created a static one page website with TailwindCSS, and used Svelte + SvelteKit to talk to the Storyblok CMS API, and populate the website with content. Whole website is easily deployed on Vercel.
